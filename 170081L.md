Learned about smart contracts and how they are used to provide instructions for the blockchain network. And in this assignment system, the framework was very high-level and abstract, so it was easy to add/change new transactions without modifying or worrying about the underlying blockchain system.
Learned about how blockchain networks manage new transactions. For example, in the deployed HyperLedger Fabric network, Raft, the consensus algorithm, was used.
